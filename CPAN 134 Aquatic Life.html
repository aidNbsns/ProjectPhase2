<center>According to the World Register of Marine Species, WoRMS, the total number of marine species known <br> to us is 
  about 240,000 species (2021 census). However, it is estimated that there are 1.4 -1.6 million marine species on earth (Bouchet, 2006.).</center>

<center>The Census of Marine Life was an international project spanning 10 years that recorded the diversity, distribution, and abundance of life in 
  the ocean. More than 2,700 scientists from 80 
  nations contributed to the Census. The results of their research, which included 540 marine expeditions, were reported at 
  The Royal Society, London, in October 2010.

  <br><br>

  During the Census, scientists found and formally described more than 1,200 new marine species, with thousands more awaiting formal 
  descriptions; discovered and mapped areas in the ocean where marine species congregate; and documented long-term and widespread declines in 
  marine life as well as species resilience and recovery.</center>
