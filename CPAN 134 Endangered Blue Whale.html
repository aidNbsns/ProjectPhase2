    <b>The Endangered Blue Whale</b>
    <br>
</h1>

<center>It is hard to believe that the largest animal known to man is one of the most <br>
endangered animals in the ocean. <br><br>

During the industrial revolution whaling was big business, and Blue Whales were <br>
hunted for their meat and blubber which was used in the production of oil, soap, <br>
perfume and cosmetics. <br><br>

Commercial hunting lead the Blue Whale alarmingly close to becoming an extinct <br>
marine animal, however in 1966 they were protected by the International Whaling <br>
Commission. <br><br>

Although commercial whaling is no longer a threat to Blue Whales, their dwindling <br>
population now faces new threats like climate change and pollution, making the Blue <br>
Whale one of the oceans most endangered marine species.</center>
